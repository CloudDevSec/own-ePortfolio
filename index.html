                            This project demonstrates the use of Terraform, an open-source infrastructure automation tool, to deploy a basic AWS infrastructure. This includes the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a subnet, an EC2 instance, and an S3 bucket. By using Terraform, the infrastructure can be managed as code and the provisioning, scaling, and management of AWS resources can be automated. This project serves as an exemplar of optimal practices for the automation of infrastructure in the cloud and can serve as a foundation for the development of more complex infrastructure configurations.
